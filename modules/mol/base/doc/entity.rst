This document describes the :class:`EntityHandle` and the related classes.

The Handle Classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: CreateEntity()

   Creates a new entity. The created entity is empty, that is, it does not
   contain any atoms, residues, chains, bonds or torsions. To populate the
   entity, use an :doc:`entity editor <editors>`.
   
   :returns: The newly created :class:`EntityHandle`
   
.. class:: EntityHandle

  The entity class represents a molecular structure. Such a structure is in
  general made up of one or more chains of residues, which in turn are
  formed by one or more atoms.

  The interface of entities is tailored to biological macromolecules, but this
  does not prevent it to be used for molecules in general: An entity also
  represent a ligand or a collection of water molecules - hence the rather
  generic name.

  .. attribute:: chains
    
    List of all chains of this entity. The chains are in the same 
    order they have been added, for example the order they have been listed 
    in a PDB file.
    
    Also available as :meth:`GetChainList`. To access a single chain, use 
    :meth:`FindChain`.
    
    This property is read-only.

  an introduction ,see :doc:`../../intro-01`.
  
  .. attribute:: chains
   
    List of all chains of this entity. The chains are in the same 
    order they have been added.
    
    Also available as :meth:`GetChainList`. To access a single chain, use 
    :meth:`FindChain`.
    
    This property is read-only.

    :type: :class:`ChainViewList` (list of :class:`ChainView`)

  .. attribute:: chain_count
    
    Number of chains. Read-only. See :meth:`GetChainCount`.
    
    :type: :class:`int`
    
  .. attribute:: residues
    
    List of all residues of this entity. The returned residues are first 
    sorted by chain and then from N- to C-terminus.
    
    This property is read-only.
    
    **Example usage:**
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      for res in ent.residues:
        print(res.name, res.atom_count)
    
    Also available as :meth:`GetResidueList`. To access a single residue, use 
    :meth:`FindResidue`. 
    
    :type: :class:`ResidueViewList` (list of :class:`ResidueView`)
    
  .. attribute:: residue_count
    
    Number of residues. Read-only. See :meth:`GetResidueCount`.
    
    :type: :class:`int`

  .. attribute:: atoms

    Get list of all atoms of this entity. To access a single atom, use
    :meth:`FindAtom`.
    
    This property is read-only. Also available as :meth:`GetAtomList`

    :type: :class:`int`

  .. attribute:: bounds
  
    Axis-aligned bounding box of the entity view. Read-only.
    
    :type: :class:`ost.geom.AlignedCuboid`

  .. attribute:: handle
  
     The underlying :class:`handle <EntityHandle>` of the entity view. Also

  .. method:: CreateFullView()

    Returns a copy of this entity. Provided for `duck-typing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing>` purposes.
    
    :rtype: :class:`EntityView`

  .. method:: AddChain(chain_handle[, view_add_flags])

    Add chain to view. By default, only the chain is added to the view, but not 
    its residues and atoms. This behaviour can be changed by passing in an
    appropriate set of `view_add_flags`.

    The following example just adds a chain without residues and atoms:

    .. code-block:: python

        pdb = ost.io.LoadPDB(<PDB file name>)
        v = pdb.CreateEmptyView()
        v.AddChain(pdb.chains[0])

    To get the chain with residues and atoms, go like:

    .. code-block:: python

        pdb = ost.io.LoadPDB(<PDB file name>)
        v = pdb.CreateEmptyView()
        v.AddChain(pdb.chains[0], ost.mol.INCLUDE_ALL)

    Note that the view above still lacks bonds which can be added with the
    :meth:`AddAllInclusiveBonds` method.

    :param residue_handle: The residue handle to be added
    :type  residue_handle: :class:`ResidueHandle`
    :param view_add_flags: An ORed together combination of :class:`ViewAddFlag`

Other Entity-Related Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: CreateViewFromAtomList(atom_list)

  Returns a view made up of the atoms in *atom_list*. All atoms are required to
  be atoms of the same entity. Duplicate atoms are only added to the view once.
  
  :param atom_list: the atoms

                                   handle=EntityHandle())
 
  This function behaves exactly like :meth:`EntityHandle.Copy`, except that only
  atoms, residues, chains and bonds that are present in the view will be 
  copied.
   
  :param view: is the view to be converted to a handle
  :param include_exlusive_atoms: if true, atoms that are part of an exclusive
       bond (only one bond partner is included in the view) will also be included

Residue Numbering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: ResNum(num, ins_code='\\0')

  Number for a residue. The residue number has a numeric part and an (optional)
  insertion-code. You can work with this object as if it was an integer and
  comparison will look first at the numeric part and then the insertion-code.
  All access to existing objects is read-only. Openstructure supports a range
  of (-8388608 to 8388607) for the numeric part. However, the PDB format only 
  supports a range of (-999, 9999). This becomes relevant when a structure is 
  saved in PDB format where an IOException is raised if the PDB range is not 
  respected.

  :param num: Numeric part of residue number.
  :type num:  :class:`int`
  :param ins_code: Alpha-numeric part of residue number (optional insertion
                   code). Only first character kept.
  :type ins_code:  :class:`str`

  .. attribute:: num

    Numeric part of residue number.

    :type: :class:`int`

  .. attribute:: ins_code

    Alpha-numeric part of residue number (insertion code). Single character.

    :type: :class:`str`

  .. method:: GetNum

    :returns: :attr:`num`

  .. method:: GetInsCode

    :returns: :attr:`ins_code`


ChainType
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A ChainType fills the :attr:`ChainHandle.type` attribute. Different types are
described in the :class:`ChainType` enum. The type is set with an editor in
:meth:`EditorBase.SetChainType`. Further convenience functions are described
here.

.. class:: ChainType

  The ChainType enum enumerates all types defined by the PDB for the MMCif file
  format. Following values are supported:

    ``CHAINTYPE_POLY``, ``CHAINTYPE_NON_POLY``, ``CHAINTYPE_WATER``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_PEPTIDE_D``, ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_PEPTIDE_L``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_DN``, ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_RN``, ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_SAC_D``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_SAC_L``, ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_DN_RN``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_UNKNOWN``, ``CHAINTYPE_MACROLIDE``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_CYCLIC_PSEUDO_PEPTIDE``, ``CHAINTYPE_POLY_PEPTIDE_DN_RN``,
    ``CHAINTYPE_N_CHAINTYPES``

  Where ``CHAINTYPE_N_CHAINTYPES`` holds the number of different types available.

.. function:: ChainTypeFromString(identifier)

   Create a ChainType item for a given string.

   :param identifier: String to request a type for.
   :type identifier: :class:`str`
   :raises: :class:`runtime_error` if **identifier** is unrecognised.

   :returns: :class:`ChainType`

.. function:: StringFromChainType(type)

   Return the String identifier for a given **type**.

   :param type: To be translated
   :type type: :class:`ChainType`
   :raises: :class:`runtime_error` if **type** is unrecognised.

   :returns: :class:`str`


ViewAddFlag
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: ViewAddFlag

  Defines flags controlling behaviour of routines adding handles to views:

  * ``INCLUDE_ATOMS`` - Include all atoms when adding a residue handle to a view
  * ``INCLUDE_RESIDUES`` - Include all residues when adding a chain to a view
  * ``INCLUDE_CHAINS`` - Include all chains when creating a new entity view
  * ``INCLUDE_ALL`` = ``INCLUDE_ATOMS`` | ``INCLUDE_RESIDUES`` |
    ``INCLUDE_CHAINS`` - Convenience flags to include all substructures
  * ``CHECK_DUPLICATES`` - If set, it will be checked that no duplicates are
    created when adding a new handle

  Flags can be ORed to combine them.
  

SecStructure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: SecStructure(type)

  Defines a secondary structure type following the types defined by DSSP.

  :param type: Type to be set for this object.
  :type type:  :class:`SecStructure.Type` / :class:`str`

  .. method:: IsHelical

    :return: True, if the set type is any type of helix (i.e. ALPHA_HELIX,
             PI_HELIX or THREE_TEN_HELIX)
  
  .. method:: IsExtended

    :return: True, if the set type is any type of beta sheet (i.e. EXTENDED,
             BETA_BRIDGE)

  .. method:: IsCoil

    :return: True, if the set type is any type of coil (i.e. TURN, BEND or COIL)

  .. method:: __str__

    :return: The character corresponding to the set type (see
             :class:`SecStructure.Type`)

.. class:: SecStructure.Type

  Enumerates all popssible secondary structure types distinguished by DSSP.
  Their values with the corresponding character code are listed here:

  .. hlist::
    :columns: 2

    * ``ALPHA_HELIX``     = 'H'
    * ``PI_HELIX``        = 'I'
    * ``THREE_TEN_HELIX`` = 'G'
    * ``EXTENDED``        = 'E'
    * ``BETA_BRIDGE``     = 'B'
    * ``TURN``            = 'T'
    * ``BEND``            = 'S'
    * ``COIL``            = 'C'


ChemClass
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: ChemClass(chem_class)

  The chemical class is used to broadly categorize residues based on their
  chemical properties. For example, peptides belong to some PEPTIDE_LINKING
  class. Possible values as constant variable names and as characters:

  .. hlist::
    :columns: 2

    * ``PEPTIDE_LINKING``   = 'P'
    * ``D_PEPTIDE_LINKING`` = 'D'
    * ``L_PEPTIDE_LINKING`` = 'L'
    * ``RNA_LINKING``       = 'R'
    * ``DNA_LINKING``       = 'S'
    * ``NON_POLYMER``       = 'N'
    * ``L_SACCHARIDE``      = 'X'
    * ``D_SACCHARIDE``      = 'Y'
    * ``SACCHARIDE``        = 'Z'
    * ``WATER``             = 'W'
    * ``UNKNOWN``           = 'U'

  The constants are defined directly within the :mod:`mol` module.
  Python can implicitly convert characters to objects of this type. Note however
  that only the first character of a :class:`str` object is considered!

  :param chem_class: Chemical class to set.
  :type chem_class:  :class:`str`

  .. method:: IsPeptideLinking

    :return: True, if set class is PEPTIDE_LINKING, D_PEPTIDE_LINKING or
             L_PEPTIDE_LINKING

  .. method:: IsNucleotideLinking

    :return: True, if set class is RNA_LINKING or DNA_LINKING
  

ChemType
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: ChemType

  The chemical type of a residue is a classification of all compounds obtained
  from the PDB component dictionary. For example, ions belong to the class IONS,
  amino acids to AMINOACIDS. Possible values as constant variable names and as
  characters:

  .. hlist::
    :columns: 2

    * ``IONS``             = 'I'
    * ``NONCANONICALMOLS`` = 'M'
    * ``SACCHARIDES``      = 'S'
    * ``NUCLEOTIDES``      = 'N'
    * ``AMINOACIDS``       = 'A'
    * ``COENZYMES``        = 'E'

    * ``WATERS``           = 'W'
    * ``UNKNOWN``          = 'U'

  Python can implicitly convert characters to objects of this type. Note however
  that only the first character of a :class:`str` object is considered!

  :param chem_type: Chemical type to set.
